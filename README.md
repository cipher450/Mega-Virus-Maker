<p>MVM is an advanced virus/malware maker coded in Visual Basic .NET 4. It has 61 options to customize your malware, 3 of which you can totally go wild with and just code it yourself with VBS or PowerShell script. It also has a lot of other options I call these the build options. You can make it so that the process is not killable or rather displays a BSOD screen and other bunch of options. Keep in mind that not all the build options work; I might do a new version if I have some free time or you can fork this and make the best of it!</p>

# USAGE:

I think that it's a pretty straightforward experience but in case you get stuck here is a video showcasing the software [here](https://youtu.be/mi-nG_PYLxY).

I suggest you run this in a virtual machine just in case something goes wrong...
