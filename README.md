<p>i will use the short name 'mvm' instead of the whole name cause it too long ... mvm is an advanced virus/malware maker coded in visual basic .NET 4 it has 61 options to 
customize your malware, 3 of which you can totally go wild with and just code it yourself with VBS or Powershell script it also has alot of other options i call these the build options
you can make it so that the proceses is not killable or rather displays a BSOD screen and other bunch of options , keep in mind that not all the build options works , i might do a new version if i have some free time or you can fork this and make the best of it ! </p>
